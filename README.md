# Robotic-Pool-Cleaning-Machine-Using-Arduino
Traditional method for collecting water surface floating waste is manual basis, by means of boat trash skimmer. The above methods  are costly risky and large time consuming. To eliminate the above-mentioned methods the remote-controlled water  cleaning machine was designed which helps in cleaning the water surface efficiently and eco-friendly.
apart from this we have also integrated our baot with advanced IOT based system , like it can detect garbage inside water,it has ultrasonic sensor which can measure the depth of the river or pond.
our boat is cost effective and easily operatable
