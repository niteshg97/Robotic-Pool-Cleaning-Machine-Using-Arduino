## 📌 Overview
**Agribot** is an autonomous, multi-functional agricultural robot developed to **automate essential farming tasks** such as:
- **Soil moisture sensing**
- **Seed dispensing**
- **Humidity monitoring**
- **Real-time data logging** using MQTT over Wi-Fi

This system is designed to assist farmers in **precision agriculture** by automating repetitive processes and providing live environmental data for decision-making.

> 🏆 **Awarded 2nd Prize** among 100+ teams at **NIT Patna Tech Fest** for AgriTech innovation.

## 🛠 Features
- **Autonomous Navigation** — Operates without manual control for predefined field coverage.
- **Soil Moisture Sensing** — Detects dryness level and decides whether irrigation is required.
- **Seed Dispensing Mechanism** — Dispenses seeds at fixed intervals or based on soil readiness.
- **Humidity Monitoring** — Tracks environmental conditions for crop health analysis.
- **IoT Integration (MQTT)** — Sends live data to a central dashboard for logging and analytics.
